# Windows Terminal Dropdown

## Automatically activate the built-in dropdown mode of Windows Terminal

This was intended for my personal use only. It should work for others with minimal tweaking of variables (especially `tabName`) but I don't intend to modify my script as it serves my purpose.

### Usage

1. Install [AutoIt3](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/)
2. Create an executable from the `wt-dropdown.au3` script using the installed tool
3. Place created executable in your startup directory: `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp`
